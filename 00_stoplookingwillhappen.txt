Does "Stop Looking and Focus on Yourself" Work for Introverts?

A common piece of dating advice is to stop actively searching for a partner and instead focus on improving your own life. The idea is that by building self-confidence, pursuing personal growth, and relaxing about the process, love will come naturally. This premise is repeated often in self-help books, online forums, and conversations with friends. But the question is whether or not this works for us introvert guys.

The advise is actually not entirely bad. Because some people do get obsessed with dating. It starts consuming their thoughts, defining their identity, or affecting their daily functioning. Unsurprisingly, this usually backfires. Unless you have highly desirable traits (looks, money), desperately trying to find a partner will only yield endless frustration. Introverts are, unfortunately, particularly vulnerable to this pattern, as they tend to be more prone to obsessing over things.

The advise to stop looking is meant to address this situation. Take a step back, relax and realize that there is more in life than just women. Work on yourself and girls will naturally be more attracted to you.

The problem with "stop looking and they will come" is that it is excellent avise, BUT works mostly for extroverts. The reason is that the approach requires you to make yourself available by joining in a lot of social activities. This is just assumed. Basically, no-one who says this has introverts in mind. Otherwise, they would know better.

This doesn't mean the advise is completely useless for us on the quiet side, though. It just needs to be adapted.

First and foremost, avoid desperation. If you're a man with average looks, dating is absolutely challenging. For introverts, the difficulty increases. But that doesn't mean it's impossible. Stay calm and maintain perspective without giving up entirely. Remember: dating isn't everything. There are going to be other things that excite you in life. Perhaps it's your job. Or you have a hobby like gaming or learning languages. Be happy. Don't let dating take over your life.
Next, try choosing some new hobbies. That said, make sure they are suitable for meeting women. Some activities are more suitable for this than others. For example, language exchange meetups, cooking classes, and improv theater are highly interactive settings where conversation flows naturally. However, don't join these activities solely to find dates. You should have genuine interest. If you don't enjoy it, don't do it.

It's also advisable to keep working on dating apps. Don't abandon online dating out of frustration. Instead, invest time in improving your profile. The biggest factor is usually photos - get high-quality pictures that show you in good lighting, doing interesting activities, and presenting yourself well. 

The last piece of advise is actually the most effective one. For men looking to improve their dating prospects, going to the gym and getting in shape is the single most effective action available to most people. Physical fitness improves appearance, confidence, and health. The results are nearly guaranteed if you put in consistent effort.
